==Long story short: API key is randomly generated bytes; it is used to identify a service, NOT a user. Usually do not have any expiration time, unless an admin explicitly removes it==

Cloud Endpoints handles both API keys and authentication schemes, such as Firebase or Auth0. The main distinction between these two is:

- API keys identify the calling project — the application or site — making the call to an API.
- Authentication tokens identify a user — the person — that is using the app or site.

## API keys provide project authorization

To decide which scheme is most appropriate, it's important to understand what API keys and authentication can provide.

API keys provide

- **Project identification** — Identify the application or the project that's making a call to this API
- **Project authorization** — Check whether the calling application has been granted access to call the API and has enabled the API in their project
API keys aren't as secure as authentication tokens (see [Security of API keys](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/when-why-api-key#security_of_api_keys))


API keys are generally not considered secure; they are typically accessible to clients, making it easy for someone to steal an API key. Once the key is stolen, it has no expiration, so it may be used indefinitely, unless the project owner revokes or regenerates the key. While the restrictions you can set on an API key mitigate this, there are better approaches for authorization.


An API may restrict some or all of its methods to require API keys. It makes sense to do this if:
- You do want to block anonymous traffic. API keys identify an application's traffic for the API producer, in case the application developer needs to work with the API producer to debug an issue or show their application's usage.
- You want to control the number of calls made to your API.
- You want to identify usage patterns in your API's traffic. You can see application usage in [APIs & services](http://console.developers.google.com).
- You want to filter logs by API key.

API keys cannot be used for:
- Identifying individual users — API keys don't identify users, they identify projects.
- Secure authorization.
- Identifying the creators of a project.
