The API configuration created when you upload an API definition. We will create the API definition as an [[OpenAPI]] spec. Each time we upload an [[API definition]], API Gateway creates a new API config. That is, we can create an AOU config but we cannot later modify it. If we later edit the API definition in the [[OpenAPI]] spec and then upload the edited [[API definition]], we create a new API config.
