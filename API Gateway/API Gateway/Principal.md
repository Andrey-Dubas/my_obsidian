A principal is an identity that can be granted access to a resource. For authentication, Google APIs support two types of principals: [user accounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#user-accounts) and [service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts).

Whether you use a user account or a service account to authenticate depends on your use case. You might use both, each at different stages of your project or in different development environments.

#### User accounts

User accounts represent a developer, administrator, or any other person who interacts with Google APIs and services.

Use your user credentials to [impersonate a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/use-service-account-impersonation).
