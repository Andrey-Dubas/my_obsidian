ClusterIP is the default type of Service in Kubernetes. It can be likened to a private phone line inside a company. You can’t dial in from the outside, but once you’re in the building (or in this case, the cluster), you can use the phone to reach other departments.

==ClusterIP exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP.== It makes the Service only reachable within the cluster, not from the outside. For instance, a set of backend microservices in an application might use ClusterIP to communicate with each other internally within the cluster.

# Pros and Cons

Pros of ClusterIP include:

1. Isolation: It’s secure because it’s not exposed to the external network.
2. Simplicity: It’s easy to set up and use.

The primary con of ClusterIP is its lack of accessibility from outside the cluster, which might be a problem for Services that need to be exposed to the outside world.
