Removing an iten from the page does not have to remove the actual cell and shift other cells to reoccupy the freed space. Instead, the cell can be marked as deleted and ==in-memory== [[availability list]]. The availability list stores offsets of freed segments **(globally?)** and a pointer to the freed value. When inserting a new cell, we first check the availability list to find if there's a segment where it may fit. [[SQLite]] calls unoccupied segments freeblocks and stores a pointer to the first freeblock in the [[page header]].
