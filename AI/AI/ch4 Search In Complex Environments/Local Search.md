[[Local Search]] algorithms operate by searching from a start state to neighboring states, without keeping  track of the paths, nor the set of states have been reached. [[Local Search]] is not systematic - we might never explore a portion of the search space where the solution resides. However, there are advantages:
- use very little memory
- they can often find reasonable solutions in a large state spaces where systematic algorithms are less effective.
Local search algorithms can also solve **optimisation problems**, in which the aim is to find the best state according to an **objective function**.
