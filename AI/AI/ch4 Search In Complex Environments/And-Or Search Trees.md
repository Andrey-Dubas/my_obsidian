Use [[And-Or Search Trees]] when the environment is [[Nondeterministic Environment]]. 
In deterministic world, the only branching introduced caused by agent's action. We call these nodes [[OR Node]]s. 
In [[Nondeterministic Environment]] branching also caused by environment "choice". We call these nodes [[And Nodes]]. e.g. _suck_ action in may results in different states (clear current tile or clean both tiles).
One key aspect of algo is how it deals with cycles, which often arise in non-deterministic problems. (e.g. action sometimes has no effect or unintended effect can be corrected). If the current state is identical to a state on a path to the root, it returns a failure. It means the solution is a noncyclic path.
[[And-Or Search Trees]] can be explored by [[Breadth-First Search]] of [[Best-First Search]]. The concept of heuristic function must be modified to estimate the cost of a contingent solution rather than a sequence.
