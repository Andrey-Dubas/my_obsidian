In a deterministic environment any action has a single guaranteed effect, and no failure or uncertainty. On the contrary is a non-deterministic environment. In this environment, **the same task performed twice may produce different results or may even fail completely**.

a **nondeterministic** environment is one in which actions are characterized by their _possible_ outcomes, but no probabilities are attached to them.

Agent doesn't know what state it transitions to after taking an action.
We call a set of physical states that the agent believes are possible a [[Belief State]].
In partially observable and nondeterministic envorinments, the solution to a problem is no longer a sequence, but rather a [[Conditional Plan]] ([[Contingency Plan]] or strategy)
