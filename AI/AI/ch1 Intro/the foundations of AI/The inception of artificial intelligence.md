The first work that is now generally recognised as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.
They drew 3 sources:
- knowledge of the basic physiology and function of neurons in the brain; 
- a formal analysis of propositional logic due to Russel and Whitehead;
- Turing's theory of computation.
They proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterised as being on or off.
