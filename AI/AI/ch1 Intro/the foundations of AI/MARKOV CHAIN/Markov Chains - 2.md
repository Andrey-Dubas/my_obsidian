State 1 is a **transient state** - a state, that Markov chain might return to this state on;y finitely often, with probability 1.
Formally
P(Xn = i | i -> infinite ) = 0

states 1 and 2 are **recurrent state**s

In this type of chain, where some state are unreachable from others, the markov chain is **reducible**
