**First Incompleteness Theorem**: "Any consistent formal system F within which a certain **amount of elementary arithmetic** can be carried out is incomplete; i.e. there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F

Result: we need to accept the fact that any formal system contains rules that are outside of system.

Gödel said that mathematics 
- incomplete -a __complete__ formal system of math is impossible
Proof: lets have all logical operations (or, and, follows, not...) assigned to numbers. 0 got its own number, and there is an operation "immediate successor of"
Formulas also got decoded, f.e. 0 = 0
would be decoded to 5 6 5. we take prime numbers for each term and raise each to the power of 5 6 5.
The prime numbers - 2 3 5
2^5 * 3^6 *5^5´= 24300000
so 243000000 is the Gödel number of equation 0=0.

Lets have an axion for natural numbers - Peano axion.
~(sx = 0)
no successor of any number x equal 0
Lets have the following axion
"there is no proof for the statement with Gödel number g" numbered as g.
So that axion is unprovable.
If you proof something that has no proof...
Contradiction!!! So the mathematical system is inconsistent
Or there is a true statement that has no proof.
The mathematical system is incomplete

There is the second (strong) Godel's theory:
"Logicall completeness (or incompleteness) of any axiom system cannot be prove by the system. To proof it, we need to get **stronger** system (with additional axioms)"
