For a simple vacuum-cleaner agent, we have to specify the performance measure, the environment, agent's actuators and sensors. We group it together under the heading of the [[Task Environment]]. Acronym is PEAS (**P**erformance, **E**nvironment, **A**ctualors, **S**ensors).

Properties for [[Task Environment]]:
- **Fully Observable** vs. **Partially Observable** - if an agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point of time, then the environment is **fully observable**.
