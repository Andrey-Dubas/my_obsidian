A constraint satisfaction problem consists of 3 components:
- set of variables
- Domain (a set of allowed values for specific variable)
- a set of constrains that expressed as (scope, relation) => e.g. ((x1, x2), x1 < x2).

CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) deals with **assigning** values to variables. The assignment that does not violate domains and constraints is called **consistent** or legal assignment.
A **complete assignment** is the one in which for every variable there is an assignment value.
A **partial Assignment** is one that leaves some variables unassingment.

CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) is NP-complete problem, but there are subclasses that can be solved efficiently.
