We can evaluate a search algorithm performance in for Ways
#### Completeness
Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one, and to correctly report failure when there is not?
To be complete, a search algo must be **systematic** in the way  it explores an infinite **state space** making sure it can eventually rach any state that is connected to the initial state.

#### Cost Optimality
Does it find a solution with the lowest path cost of all solutions?

Time Complexity,
Space Optimality
