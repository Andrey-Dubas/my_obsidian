A search problem can be defined as follows:
- a set of possible states that environment can be. We call it a **state space**
- initial state
- a set of one goal states.
- the actions
- Transition model
Result(Arad, toZerind) = Zerind
- an *action cost function*. c(s, a, s') - action cost function of transition from state S to state S' using action a.
