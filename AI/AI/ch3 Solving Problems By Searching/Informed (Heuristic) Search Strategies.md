Can find the solutions more efficiently that an uninformed strategy.
The hints come in the form of **heuristic function**
h(n) = estimated cost of the cheapest path from the state at node n to a goal state
e.g. in route-finding problems, we can estimate the distance to goal by computing the straight-line distance on the map between the 2 points.
